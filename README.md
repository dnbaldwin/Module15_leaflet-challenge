This is Module 15 Challenge Project - Visualising Earthquake Data using Leaflet.

Earthquake data was obtained via the USGS API at https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes/

The Earthquakes Leaflet Site can be visualised by running index.html using any server program. 

In its current form, the website loads earthquakes recorded by USGS in the last seven days.

The individual earthquake data including magnitude, estimated depth (km) and time of onset and event location can be obtained by clicking on the individual earthquake marker.

The radius of the marker is reflective of the measured magnitude

The color of the marker reflects its origin depth in kilometres, as shown in the legend.

A selection overlay permits map layers of several different types, including a base map, a general topographic map and a USGS topographic map. The earthquake markers can also be selected / deselected using this tool.
